# Greeny – A Tree-Planting Game with Real-World Crypto Rewards

## Overview

Greeny is a mobile game where players grow fantasy tree characters, complete quests, and unlock real-world rewards like tree planting. The game uses a dual-token system ($LEAF and $TREE) to connect in-game activity to actual reforestation efforts.

## How It Works

- Players tap to grow tree characters and forests
- Earn $LEAF tokens through activity or watching ads
- Unlock $TREE tokens that trigger planting of a real tree
- Players receive:
  - A Tree Certificate
  - A photo of their tree
  - GPS location to view it on a map

In the future, verified players in rural areas can become “Planters” and earn tokens by planting trees and submitting geotagged photos.

## Monetization + Sustainability

Revenue comes from:
- Ad views
- In-app purchases
- Token reserves
- NFT collectibles
- Sponsorships and grants (Gitcoin, ReFi DAO, etc.)

## Goals

- Launch MVP prototype (2025)
- Apply for Gitcoin and ReFi DAO grants
- Build an open community of developers and eco-conscious gamers
